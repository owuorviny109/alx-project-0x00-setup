### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with modal dialogs, so that I can input data and see dynamic content updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the modal trigger button THEN the system SHALL open a modal dialog
2. WHEN I submit the modal form THEN the system SHALL capture the input data
3. WHEN the modal form is submitted THEN the system SHALL update the page content dynamically
4. WHEN I close the modal THEN the system SHALL hide the modal dialog

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view posts from an external API, so that I can see dynamic content in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the posts page THEN the system SHALL fetch data from JSONPlaceholder API
2. WHEN the API data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display posts using PostCard components
3. WHEN a post is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the title, content, and userId

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the users page THEN the system SHALL fetch user data from the provided API
2. WHEN user data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display users using UserCard components
3. WHEN a user card is displayed THEN the system SHALL show name, email, and address information
4. IF the user API request fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain consistent layout and styling, so that the application has a professional appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any page loads THEN the system SHALL display the Header component with navigation
2. WHEN components are styled THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS classes
